# JOKES - ENGLISH

## ADDING JOKES:

Write a short title for your joke and add it at the top. There are a few simple rules to make this enjoyable for everybody:
- Don't submit offensive, sexual or dark humour jokes.
  - Foul language is allowed, but only to add emphasis or in known sentences and without overdoing it.
- Avoid context as much as possible. Leave the joke's essence so that readers can complete it the way they want
  - If the joke is too technichal, make sure the title provides the context.
- Keep it as short as possible. Leave just what's necessary.
- Follow this format to make it easy to read:
  - Write narration and descriptions in short sentences.
  - Write conversations as lists.
  - In question and answer jokes, write **Q:** and **A:** before their line.
- **Have fun!**
